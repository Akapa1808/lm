\chapter{Preface}

This book is written as a companion book to the
Advanced Linear Models for Data Science
Coursera class. Also check out the[Data Science Specialization] by the same author. However, if you do not take the class, the book mostly stands on its own. A
useful component of the book is a series of YouTube videos that comprise the
Coursera class.

The book is intended to be a low cost introduction to the important field of
advanced linear models. The intended audience are students who are numerically
and computationally literate, have taken a
course on statistical inference, have taken a regression class, can program in R
and have a fairly high level of mathematical sophistication including: linear algebra,
multivariate calculus and some proof-based mathematics.
The book is offered for free with variable pricing (html, pdf, epub, mobi) on
LeanPub.
