\chapter{Background}

Before we begin we need a few matrix prerequisites. Let

$$
f: \mathbb{R}^p \rightarrow \mathbb{R}
$$

be a function from the $p$ dimensional real line to the real line.
Assume that $f$ is linear in the sense that

$$
f(\mathfb{x}) = \mathbf{a x}
$$

Then $$ \nabla f = \mathbf{a}.$$
